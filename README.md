# School_District_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of the School District Analysis was to identify key metrics by school campus and district, focusing on student’s math and reading scores. It was suspected that cheating had occurred in Thomas High School, Nineth Grade Class. As a result, the board requested a review of the school’s grades and removal of altered scores to be replaced by “null” entries. 
# Results 
In total there were 462 student scores where null data was applied. Thereafter, recalculating percentages for passing grades in math, reading and overall grades. While the count of students overall did not change, the grades the students from Thomas High School received in math and reading were turned into null entries. This slightly impacted the over school rates for math, reading and overall.
